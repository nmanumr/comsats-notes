ZILL 1 Alternatively notes might be available at Photocopier with Code 202 Course Outline \u00b6 There are following chapter we will study through out the course from the above mentioned book: Chapter 02 - First order Differential Equations (Ex 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5) Chapter 03 - Modeling with First Differential Equations (Ex 3.2) Chapter 04 - Higher Order Differential Equations with constant coefficients (Ex 4.3, 4.4, 4.7) Chapter 06 - Higher Order Differential Equations with variable coefficients (Ex 6.1, 6.3) Chapter 08 - System of Linear Differential Equations (Ex 8.1, 8.6) Chapter 12 - Partial Differential Equations (Ex 12.3, 12.4) Intro to Differential Equations \u00b6 Differential Equations are the equation involving derivatives. For example, following is the algebraic equation of family of parabolas: \\[ y = x^2 + c \\] We can take can derivative of the above equation wrt \\(dx\\) and write it as: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x \\] This equation is called a differential equation and this also gives the same family of parabolas. Types of Differential Equations \u00b6 There are two type of differential equations: Ordinary Differential Equation (ODEs): which involves ordinary derivatives like: $$ \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x $$ Partial Differential Equation (PDEs): which involves partial derivatives like: $$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 5 $$ Tip We normally use partial derivatives when a function have less then 1 independent variables. Solution of Differential Equations \u00b6 For equation ( \\(x^2+3x+2=0\\) ) the solution are the values of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation (ie \\(x=-1\\) , \\(x=-2\\) ). Similarly solution of differential equation (ie \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=2x\\) ) is the the value of dependent variable without derivatives ( \\(y\\) ) which satisfies the equation. Theses solutions can be found by taking the integral on both side. 1 st order differential equations required single integral for solution. 2 nd order differential equations required double integral for solution. and so on... But there are some optimal techniques that can be used to solve the higher order differential equations. Solution types of Differential Equations \u00b6 Particular Solution ( \\(y=x^2+2\\) ): solution with fixed constant value. General Solution ( \\(y=x^2+c\\) ): solution with arbitrary constant value. Separation of Variable Method \u00b6 Works for 1 st order differential equations. For example: $$ \\frac{dy}{dx}=x ^2y ^2 $$ $$ \\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{x^2+1}{y+x} $$ $$ \\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{x+2y+1}{x^2+y} $$ Only works if variables can be separated from the differential equation. For example: Works for: $$ \\frac{dy}{dx}=x ^2y ^2 $$ Not works for: $$ \\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{x^2+1}{y+x} $$ So in general any equation of form $$ \\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{f(x)}{g(y)} $$ can be solve be solved using this method. Solution Steps \u00b6 Separate the variables of the equation. like $$ \\frac{dy}{dx}=x ^2y ^2 \\implies \\frac{dy}{y^2}=x ^2dx $$ Apply integral on both side and solve the equation $$ \\displaystyle\\int\\frac{dy}{y^2}=\\displaystyle\\int x ^2dx $$ Exercise Solutions \u00b6 Questions Solved in class: 1, 6, 14, 34 Exercise 2.2 on Slader The book link wasn't provided the teacher. \u21a9","title":"Lecture 01"},{"location":"MTH242/lec01/#lecture-01","text":"- Topic: Introduction to Differential Equations - Time: Mon Feb 03 2020 21:30:00 GMT+0500 / PT30M - Room: C-5","title":"Lecture 01"},{"location":"MTH242/lec01/#recommended-book","text":"Differential Equations by DENNIS G.
